Project: AbroEd Visa Consultancy - Complete Website Development

Project Overview:
This project involved designing and developing a full-featured website for AbroEd, a visa and education consultancy. The goal was to create a professional, trustworthy, and user-friendly online presence that effectively generates leads and provides valuable information to prospective students.

The Solution (A Multi-Page Website):
The site is structured into several key pages, each serving a distinct purpose in the client's journey:

Homepage (index.html): The main hub featuring an about section, core values, service highlights, a dynamic testimonial slider, and key statistics to build trust.

Study Abroad (Study.html): A dedicated page outlining popular study destinations (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Europe) with key information about programs, visas, and top universities.

Coaching Programs (Coaching.HTML): Showcases the language test preparation services offered (IELTS, PTE, Duolingo, Spoken English).

Brochure (Brochure.HTML): A printable, informative page that summarizes the company's services, strengths, and destination countries.

FAQ (FAQ.HTML): An interactive Frequently Asked Questions section with collapsing answers to address common client concerns.

Appointment Booking (Book an Appointment.HTML): A functional form for users to schedule consultations, capturing crucial lead information.

Student Inquiry Form (Student Inquiry Form.HTML): A shorter, streamlined form for initial student queries and lead generation.

Partnership Page (Partner Up with AbroEd.HTML): A page aimed at B2B clientele, encouraging educational institutions and agents to partner with the consultancy.

Technical Implementation:

Front-End: Built from scratch with semantic HTML5 and vanilla CSS3 for optimal performance and control.

Layout: Utilized modern CSS techniques including Flexbox and Grid to create complex, responsive layouts.

Interactivity: Enhanced with lightweight vanilla JavaScript for the FAQ toggle and testimonial slider.

Design: Features a consistent and warm color scheme (Sienna, Gold, Cream) to evoke professionalism and approachability.

Responsiveness: Fully responsive design ensures a seamless experience across all device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Key Outcome:
This project delivered a cohesive and functional digital platform for AbroEd, effectively communicating its services and streamlining its client acquisition process through intuitive forms and clear information architecture.architecture.
